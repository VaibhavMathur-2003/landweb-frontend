# No-Code Website Builder

## Features
- **Intuitive Interface:** Users can design websites visually by dragging and dropping pre-built customizable components onto a canvas.
- **Effortless Code Generation:** Upon completion of website design, the application generates the necessary code automatically.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Complete authentication and authorization using JWT tokens are implemented for secure user access.
- **State Management:** Redux is utilized for state management and structuring.
